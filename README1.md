# Recipe Gallery

This is a simple Recipe Gallery application built using React. It displays a curated list of recipes with their titles, ingredients, and images.

## Getting Started

To view the Recipe Gallery, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-gallery.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd recipe-gallery`
3. Install dependencies by running: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the Recipe Gallery.

## Layout and Styling

The Recipe Gallery is styled using inline CSS within the RecipeGallery component. Each recipe card is displayed in a card layout, with the recipe title, ingredients list, and image. The layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Components

- **App.js**: The main component that renders the RecipeGallery component.
- **RecipeGallery.js**: The component responsible for rendering the gallery of recipes. It iterates over a list of recipe data and displays each recipe in a card format.

## Recipe Data

Recipe data is stored directly within the RecipeGallery component as an array of objects. Each object represents a recipe and includes properties such as id, title, ingredients, and image URL.

## Dependencies

This project uses Create React App for bootstrapping the React application.
